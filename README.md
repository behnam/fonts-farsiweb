FarsiWeb Fonts
==============
*FarsiWeb's Persian Fonts Collection*

NOTE: This is a beta release and contains known bugs, so use the fonts at your
own risk. But we appreciate bug reports or requests for enhancements.

According to our best knowledge, FarsiWeb Fonts are the first Unicode compliant
versions of these fonts, and the first set of fonts ever to conform to the
Iranian national standard ISIRI 6219. The fonts currently support the Persian,
Arabic, and Azerbaijani languages (as written in the Arabic script).

The fonts are conforming to the Unicode, ISIRI 6219, OpenType, and Adobe glyph
naming standards as much as possible. The support will increase in newer
versions, which will contain more glyphs, and better support for small sizes
for selected fonts which makes them suitable for web use.
