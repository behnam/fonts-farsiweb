{"name":"ttf-farsifonts","tagline":"FarsiFonts -- FarsiWeb's Persian Fonts Collection","body":"NOTE: This is a beta release and contains known bugs, so use the fonts at your\r\nown risk. But we appreciate bug reports or requests for enhancements.\r\n\r\nAccording to our best knowledge, FarsiFonts are the first Unicode compliant\r\nversions of these fonts, and the first set of fonts ever to conform to the\r\nIranian national standard ISIRI 6219. The fonts currently support the Persian,\r\nArabic, and Azerbaijani languages (as written in the Arabic script).\r\n\r\nThe fonts are conforming to the Unicode, ISIRI 6219, OpenType, and Adobe glyph\r\nnaming standards as much as possible. The support will increase in newer\r\nversions, which will contain more glyphs, and better support for small sizes\r\nfor selected fonts which makes them suitable for web use.\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n---------\r\nYou can freely share and distribute all of the fonts, if you don't sell them\r\ndirectly (with no accompanying software), or change or rename them.  Some of\r\nthese fonts are licensed under the GNU General Public License\r\n(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL), which will give you even more\r\nrights as a user and developer. For more details, see the license field of the\r\nfonts themselves, and the file COPYING.txt.  Other kinds of licensing is also\r\navailable from Sharif FarsiWeb Inc, which can be contacted at \"info at\r\nfarsiweb.info\".\r\n\r\nThe FarsiFonts project was sponsored by the High Council of Informatics of Iran\r\n(http://www.shci.ir/) and Sharif University of Technology\r\n(http://www.sharif.ir/). We wish to thank them for supporting standards and\r\nfree software.\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n-----\r\n* Project homepage: http://code.behnam.es/ttf-farsifonts\r\n* Bug reports: https://github.com/behnam/ttf-farsifonts/issues\r\n* Discussion: http://persian-computing.org/ mailing list","google":"UA-1218162-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
